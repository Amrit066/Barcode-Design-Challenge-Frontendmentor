## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Div box model
- CSS custom properties



### What I learned

During this project I learned the use of different CSS selectors. Also while building this project, I came to know how we can make font sizes responsive, using vw, vh, vmin, and vmax.

Below, I have mentioned about how I used vmin for making text responsive.

```css
.qr-code-container{
  width: 29vmin;
}
```




### Continued development

I learned a bit about making text responsive. But there is a lot I need to look about making the whole document responsive, be its layout, text, or anything such.
Also, I use to get stuck when positioning and arranging the elements properly, which I am plannig to explore more.
